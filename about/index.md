Waratah is a kind of large shrub native to my home state, New South Wales of Australia. While this site is titled Waratah _Root_, I have never seen how its root looks like. I just like the sound of these two words.

This site is home to writings of my random thoughts on equally random topics, a lof of which have to do with one of the most fascinating places in the world - China - where I came from.
