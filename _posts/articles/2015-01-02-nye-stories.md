The New Year's Eve dinner I was invited to was quite fun. In addition to the fireworks, some guests shared interesting stories too, which I can't help sharing with my Facebook friends.

The hostess was a Hong Kong business woman visiting Sydney for vacation, a kind elderly lady. The guests included a young couple newly migrated from Hong Kong and New Zealand, a real estate agent man who came from Solomon Islands in 1978, and my friend who invited me.

The real estate agent man was born to Chinese parents emigrated to Solomon Islands from China before communists seized the power. They made a living by running small shops selling products mostly made in P.R.C., like the antique Phoenix bicycles. He said that by doing so they were doing their "patriotic duties". He seemed to be very pro-China and claimed that "overseas Chinese are very patriotic and just hope that China is strong". (He didn't say directly but implied that it's OK even if the country is ruled by a totalitarian government.) I knew that the young couple might disagree - for example, they held strong opinions against Beijing's heavy-handed handling of the recent pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong - but they kept quiet.
He also told some "fascinating" stories of Chinese gangsters in Sydney's Chinatown, like how they extorted protection fees from shop owners. He said that not all businesses cooperated, such as the Koreans, and they received bullet holes in the shopfront.

I think he was racist. He mentioned that some Chinese-Solomon Islanders "even married the locals and ended up having kids with chocolate-coloured skin". That remark was abhorrent, and as a banana-coloured person, I didn't know how to respond. But the young Hong Kong lady commented gracefully, "I think that's a very cool skin colour." (She is very charming, by the way.) For some reason he also mentioned Lee Kuan Yew's racist thinking, saying that the statesman was furious when he found out that his daughter was dating an Indian man.

Carrying on with that topic, my lawyer friend shared more stories of the Singaporean leader. (She came to Australia from Singapore as a student in 1970s.) She said that Lee's government at that time was so obsessed with the idea of "preserving the superior Chinese-Singaporean bloodline" that they even went the great lengths to do matchmaking for its overseas citizens. One day in 1970s the Singaporean consulate in Sydney contacted her to invite her to a government-sponsored speed dating event featuring top-tier catering, so that she could meet elite Singaporean men. They advised that to marry bright Singaporeans to produce "high-quality" Singaporean babies was in the national interest. She was stunned and didn't know what to do. Then she decided to give it a go just for the sake of the extravagant food. She estimated that no one had exchanged phone numbers.

To the disappointment of the government, she eventually married a western man and diluted her pure Singaporean genes.

Looking back, it seems amazing how far people have moved on since then. I hope young people today would never judge someone on their skin colours, be it chocolate or coconut, nor would they feel that their genetic traits should have anything to do with their cultural identities or the national interest of their countries. I think that's the progress of civilization.

Happy New Year, everyone. :-)
