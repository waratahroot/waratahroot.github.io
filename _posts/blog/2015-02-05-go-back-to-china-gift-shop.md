At the "go-back-to-China" gift shop, I overheard a conversation between a customer and the shop owner. From her accent I could tell that the lady was from northeastern China. She said that the full-time business she was doing here was buying milk powder and other Australian food products and shipping them to clients in China via the postal service. The connections she had accumulated while working as a midwife back in China had served to build up her network of patrons, most of whom new parents concerning about the safely of Chinese baby formula I guess. She mentioned that usually she shopped around in local pharmacies and supermarkets to buy loads of products at the retail price and drove to an international shipping agent to send them off to China. It seemed to me that the shop owner was interested in becoming one of her suppliers, hence the conversation.

Before, apart from seeing the “2 cans per customer” sign at the baby formula aisle in Woolworths, I only heard about this kind of business model from TV. This time I got to see a bit more details.

It dawned on me that Chinese people are probably among the most resourceful bunch in the world. They (me included) may not feel empowered to confront the root cause of the society's problems, but on an individual level, it appears that everyone has found a way to get around of it, either by moving away, or by paying a premium price to source goods from overseas connections, who, in turn, will carve out a living from it, or simply by putting up with it. It works, for individuals, but the "system" itself is still decaying. As the pond getting fouled, eventually all fish would struggle to breathe. I hate to say it, but that seems to be the classic Chinese way. I don't think economic development will fix it. Something is fundamentally wrong from high above, and from deep down.

Is there still hope?
