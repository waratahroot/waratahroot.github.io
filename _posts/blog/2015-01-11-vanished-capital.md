For some strange reasons I especially miss my parents and Beijing these days. Maybe it's because I have been reading a book about how the 600-year-old capital city's beautiful ancient buildings and city walls had been destroyed piece by piece since communists took over, and the plights and fights of local residents trying to protect their courtyard homes and resist the forced land seizures. That made me feel that it's not just the architectures, but pretty much every aspect of China's history and past that has been thrown away, in the name of "modernisation". It's sad because it's really unstoppable - a vanished capital, a lost home.

So many things have already gone for ever, like the Three Gorges on the Yangtze.

Home is not a symbol on the map, or a name in the books; it's the house; it's parents; it's siblings and childhood buddies; it's ancestors' graves - it's everything living in one's memory. When they are gone, home is gone.

I want to see my mother country as much as I can, before it's becoming even more unrecognisable. When it's become completely unrecognisable, it's the time I part with it for good. No need to look back any more.
