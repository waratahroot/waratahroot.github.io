Last night I dozed off on couch after dinner. As usual, sleeping this way yielded a very invigorating rest. These days I formed a habit of checking WeChat after getting up, as the social media app has suddenly born more importance to me after a lot of current and former colleagues, especially those from China, have appeared in my contact list. So, at 5:40 am, I went online, and found that many WeChat contacts have shared a same video clip over night - a TV documentary about China's depressing air pollution made by a famous investigative journalist named Chai Jing (柴静). She made it as a personal project to bring to Chinese public the awareness of this serious nation-wide issue - what it is, what has caused it, and what can be done. It's called "Under the Dome."

I think this work of Chai is a showcase of highly professional journalism and immense compassion. She began with a striking personal story. When her daughter was born in 2013, the baby was diagnosed with a benign tumour that had to be removed right after being born. As a first-time mother who had to leave her new born baby girl to the mercy of a complex medical procedure that could well take her away for good, she had went through tremendous mental distress. After her little one went through the surgery fine and has fully recovered, she has felt the most strong urge that every mother in the world has had - to protect her daughter from any possible harm this world may choose to throw at her again; yet she soon realised that there is one thing she cannot possibly flight - Beijing's air pollution. Not knowing whether the toxic air has caused her baby's tumour in the first place, she can clearly see how her treasure is being harmed by every breathe she takes. As a professional newsperson, she heeded the call to find out more about this invisible killer that is threatening every adult and child in the country. At that time she had already left the national TV station to be a full-time mother, but this new endeavour brought her back to work, as a freelance journalist this time. She invested about 1 million yuan from her own pocket in the project which took 1 year worth of tireless investigation, research, analysis and interviews to finish, and which she released to public domain to reach the widest possible audience. In the program she asked questions, showed facts, and prompted more questions and thoughts.

While most of the feedback I have seen on social media have been positive, some also brought up a controversy about Chai that she gave birth to her child in the U.S. in hope of, as some people say, getting her the American citizenship. They questioned her legitimacy in speaking for China's problem while she herself, as they perceived, has in some way "abandoned" the country. I personally don't find that allegation relevant, no matter what the real circumstances are. What she presented in her program is most likely to reflect the truth, and that has made the program a positive impact on fixing the dire issue that is facing everyone in the country. Every effort in combating the challenge should be welcomed and appreciated. People should be grateful for what she has done.

I am glad that someone in the media has done something like this. Of course, at the end of the day it's the government's job to clean things up and make up for the mistakes they have made, but the clean air is something no one can live without, and the most effective way an ordinary person can push for a change is by expressing their concern. In that sense, no one can do a better job than a celebrated journalist like Chai. Good on her.
